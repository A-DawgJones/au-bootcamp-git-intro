% June 6, 2019

# Mandatory 

## Create an account on Github

Go to [Github](https://github.com/)
(<https://github.com/>)
and 'Sign up' for an account


# Recommended

The version-control software that we will use in
Exercise 9 is called Git.
I recommend you peruse some of the resouces at:

<https://try.github.io/>

In particular, look over the "Git Handbook" link.
Also, the "Cheat Sheets" will be very useful to have
handy when you are using Git.

Here are two other resources for getting to know Git a
bit:

# Optional

If you wish to install 
[Git](https://git-scm.com/)
on your own computer, you can do so by navigating to
<https://git-scm.com/downloads>
and downloading and installing the appropriate version
for your computer.

**NOTE:** This is not mandatory for the exercise on
Thursday, because the entire exercise can be performed
on the Alabama Super Computer.
